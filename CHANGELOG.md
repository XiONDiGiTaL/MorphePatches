## [1.0.1](https://github.com/XiONDiGiTaL/MorphePatches/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2026-11-03)

Re-released: the first `patches-1.0.1.mpp` aborted at patch time and has been withdrawn.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **patches:** empty method bodies through the implementation's own `removeInstruction` instead of dexlib2's read-only instruction list
* **patches:** match the community ad composable with `isStatic`, because Morphe compares `accessFlags` exactly and the method is `public static final`
* **companion:** add the offline Tandem Study app and document it

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-01) — retired

The first published bundle, built before both patch-time fixes below. Patching with it aborts before
any change is made; use 1.0.1 instead.

### ✨ New Features
