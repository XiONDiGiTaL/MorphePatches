# Tandem

Patches for **Tandem: Language exchange** (`net.tandem`) by XiONDiGiTaL, built for
[Morphe](https://morphe.software).

The patches ship compiled in this folder: **[`patches.mpp`](patches.mpp)**. Import that file in Morphe
Manager and patch a stock Tandem 6.38.0 APK or APKM — nothing else is needed, and no build step is
required to use it.

## Patches in the bundle

All four are enabled by default; each can be turned off individually in Morphe Manager.

| Patch | What it changes | Methods touched |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Force dark mode](#force-dark-mode) | Injects an app-level night-mode call at `TandemApp.onCreate()` | 1 (injected) |
| [Bypass PairIP checks](#bypass-pairip-checks) | Empties PairIP's signature and licence checks | 2 |
| [Remove ads](#remove-ads) | Empties Tandem's community-ad composable and the ad SDKs' load methods | 11 |
| [Disable Adjust tracking](#disable-adjust-tracking) | Empties `Adjust.initSdk(...)` | 1 |

Nothing in this bundle reads, writes, fakes or re-routes billing, purchase state, sessions or
entitlement. Every patch is confined to methods that already exist in the APK.

### Force dark mode

**Effect.** Tandem ships a full dark theme — a `values-night` resource overlay plus a Compose theme
that respects `uiMode` — but the app has no appearance setting of its own, so the theme is reachable
only through the system-wide dark-mode switch. This patch turns Tandem's own dark theme on for Tandem
alone. Other apps and the system setting are untouched.

**Change.** One platform call is prepended to `net.tandem.TandemApp.onCreate()`:

```smali
const-string v0, "uimode"
invoke-virtual {p0, v0}, Landroid/content/Context;->getSystemService(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
move-result-object v0
check-cast v0, Landroid/app/UiModeManager;
const/4 v1, 0x2                     # UiModeManager.MODE_NIGHT_YES
invoke-virtual {v0, v1}, Landroid/app/UiModeManager;->setApplicationNightMode(I)V
```

`Application.onCreate()` runs once per process, before the first activity resolves a theme or a
Compose palette, so every screen starts in Tandem's night configuration. `setApplicationNightMode`
exists from API 31 and this build is minSdk 32.

**Anchor.** `net.tandem.TandemApp;->onCreate()V` — inherited unchanged by the PairIP wrapper
(`com.pairip.application.Application` only overrides `attachBaseContext`), so it is neither
obfuscated nor displaced by the integrity patch.

**Not touched.** No theme, colour, activity, layout or resource is renamed or replaced, so user
images, media, icons, dialogs and system bars keep using Tandem's own night resources. Nothing is
force-inverted.

---

### Bypass PairIP checks

**Effect.** Lets a patched, re-signed build start at all. 6.38.0 is protected with PairIP: the
manifest declares `com.pairip.application.Application`, whose `attachBaseContext` runs two gates
before Tandem initialises.

| Gate | What it does | Why a patched build trips it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SignatureCheck.verifyIntegrity(context)` | Base64 SHA-256 of the APK signing certificate, compared to expected values | Any re-signed APK mismatches and throws `SignatureTamperedException("Apk signature is invalid.")` before the first activity |
| `LicenseClient.checkLicense(context)` | Binds Play's licensing service via `LicenseActivity` | A sideloaded build cannot satisfy the licence response |

**Change.** Both bodies become a single instruction:

```smali
.method public static verifyIntegrity(Landroid/content/Context;)V
    return-void
.end method
```

Both are pure checks: `void` returns, no state other code reads, no other class calls them for a
result.

**Anchors** (stock 6.38.0 `base.apk`, `classes2.dex`):

```smali
Lcom/pairip/SignatureCheck;->verifyIntegrity(Landroid/content/Context;)V          # public static
Lcom/pairip/licensecheck/LicenseClient;->checkLicense(Landroid/content/Context;)V # public static
```

**Not touched.** PairIP's method-level protection (`VMRunner`, `StartupLauncher`) stays active, so the
classes it decrypts at runtime still load.

This patch is on by default because nothing else can run without it: the re-sign every patcher
performs is exactly what the signature check rejects.

---

### Remove ads

**Effect.** Removes Tandem's community ad slot and stops both bundled ad SDKs from requesting ads, so
no app-open, banner, interstitial or native ad is delivered or rendered.

**Change.** Three paths, eleven methods, each reduced to `return-void`:

| Path | Anchors in 6.38.0 | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tandem's community ad slot | `Ljhp;->a(Lex4;Lf79;Lpw4;Leh;Lbg5;I)V` — the one composable consuming `CommunityAdConfig(adUnitId, adSize)` for unit `ca-app-pub-4507927355231659/3667237836` | The slot emits nothing, which is the `config == null` branch the screen already handles; no ad view is created |
| AppLovin MAX | `MaxAppOpenAd.loadAd()`, `MaxInterstitialAd.loadAd()`, `MaxAdView.loadAd()`, `MaxAdView.startAutoRefresh()` | No request is made; `isReady()` stays false; banner refresh never arms |
| Meta Audience Network | `InterstitialAd.loadAd()` and `loadAd(InterstitialLoadAdConfig)`, `AdView.loadAd()` and `loadAd(AdViewLoadConfig)`, `NativeAdBase.loadAd()` and `loadAd(NativeLoadAdConfig)` | Same, for both call styles |

Both the no-argument and the `…LoadAdConfig` overloads are replaced because either call style reaches
the SDK.

**Anchors** (stock 6.38.0 `base.apk`, `classes.dex` / `classes4.dex`):

```smali
Ljhp;->a(Lex4;Lf79;Lpw4;Leh;Lbg5;I)V                                      # public static
Lcom/applovin/mediation/ads/MaxAppOpenAd;->loadAd()V                      # public
Lcom/applovin/mediation/ads/MaxInterstitialAd;->loadAd()V                 # public
Lcom/applovin/mediation/ads/MaxAdView;->loadAd()V                         # public
Lcom/applovin/mediation/ads/MaxAdView;->startAutoRefresh()V               # public
Lcom/facebook/ads/InterstitialAd;->loadAd()V                              # public
Lcom/facebook/ads/InterstitialAd;->loadAd(Lcom/facebook/ads/InterstitialAd$InterstitialLoadAdConfig;)V
Lcom/facebook/ads/AdView;->loadAd()V                                      # public
Lcom/facebook/ads/AdView;->loadAd(Lcom/facebook/ads/AdView$AdViewLoadConfig;)V
Lcom/facebook/ads/NativeAdBase;->loadAd()V                                # public
Lcom/facebook/ads/NativeAdBase;->loadAd(Lcom/facebook/ads/NativeAdBase$NativeLoadAdConfig;)V
```

R8 relocated Tandem's own classes into the default package (jadx shows them under `defpackage/`),
which is why the community composable's descriptor is the one-letter `Ljhp;`; the SDK classes keep
their package names because their consumer rules preserve the public API surface.

**Not touched.** Rewarded formats (`MaxRewardedAd`, `RewardedVideoAd`, `RewardedInterstitialAd`) stay:
they are requested only when the user chooses to earn something, so blocking them would remove a
feature rather than an annoyance. SDK initialisation also stays — nothing loads without one of the
replaced methods, and gutting `init` would break the mediation callbacks Tandem registers.

Ad delivery is decided by the client, which is why this one is patchable while Pro is not (see
[below](#not-in-the-bundle-pro-and-profile-visitors)).

---

### Disable Adjust tracking

**Effect.** Stops Tandem's bundled Adjust attribution SDK (246 classes) from initialising, so no
install, session, event or deep-link attribution is sent.

**Change.** `Adjust.initSdk(AdjustConfig)` becomes `return-void`. Tandem calls it once with app token
`w9jqbcact05c`, then calls `Adjust.enable()` and `Adjust.onResume()`.

**Anchor** (stock 6.38.0 `base.apk`, `classes2.dex`):

```smali
Lcom/adjust/sdk/Adjust;->initSdk(Lcom/adjust/sdk/AdjustConfig;)V # public static
```

**Not touched.** The two follow-up calls are left in place deliberately: `AdjustInstance.enable()`
guards itself with `checkActivityHandler(...)`, which logs and returns when no session exists, so they
are already no-ops. Tandem's deep-link handler is registered separately on the application object and
is unaffected. Tandem's Firebase Analytics usage is a different SDK and is not touched by this patch.

---

## Not in the bundle: Pro and profile visitors

Pro is server-authoritative in 6.38.0, so there is nothing local to switch. Every Pro value arrives
inside a server response — `isPro` on `DecodedPayloadAttrs`, `isUserPro` / `visitorsLimit` on
`ProfileVisitorsProps` and `ViewedProfilesProps`, `isUserPro` on `ChatListProps`, `isPro` on
`ConversationLimitProps` and on realtime `PresenceStateInternal`. There is no persisted Pro flag: the
only writer is the `set_pro_status` event the app receives from its own web content.

So a UI-level flip would only make the app *believe* the account is Pro while servers keep answering
with non-Pro limits and no visitor list — the exact behaviour of the older 6.11.1 "Premium" mod, which
forced five `isPro` / `isLifetime` getters (and which shipped alongside MT Manager's signature killer;
6.38.0 additionally has PairIP). Making visitors actually appear would mean rewriting entitlement and
limit fields in network payloads, i.e. forging the service's own answers. That is not implemented
here.

## Install

1. Use Tandem **6.38.0** (versionCode 11568) — APKM bundle or single APK.
2. In Morphe Manager, import [`patches.mpp`](patches.mpp).
3. Select your Tandem file. Keep **Bypass PairIP checks** enabled (a re-signed build will not start
   without it); enable the other three as wanted.
4. Patch, then install. The result is signed differently from the store build, so uninstall the stock
   app first and have your login details ready.

## Compatibility

Only 6.38.0 is declared, so Morphe refuses the bundle on any other version instead of silently
patching it. Adding a version is a claim that the fingerprints and the injected code were verified
against that exact build.

Reference file: APKMirror universal bundle
`sha256 17539cc675654353e5971a8fd2bea6384876c71f63b387f8d95ef6cf7502e3ca` (`base.apk`
`sha256 940797a624210ba555fc0e67e9b7ce9456c4dd811450d4e973ac716ee721942b`).

## Testing status

| Check | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kotlin compiles against patcher 2.1.0 | Pass |
| `:patches:buildAndroid` produces the bundle | Pass |
| Bundle loads via Morphe's `loadPatchesFromJar` | Pass |
| Metadata identifies `net.tandem`, 6.38.0, minSdk 32 | Pass |
| Patch applies to the real 6.38.0 `base.apk` (fingerprint match + dex assembly) | Pass |
| Injected night-mode call present in the patched dex | Pass — decompiles to `((UiModeManager) getSystemService("uimode")).setApplicationNightMode(2)` as the first statement of `onCreate()` |
| All 14 anchor methods for the other three patches present in the stock dex | Pass — ad, PairIP and Adjust anchors match in `classes.dex`, `classes2.dex`, `classes4.dex` of the reference `base.apk` |
| Unsupported versions rejected | Pass by construction — only 6.38.0 is declared |
| Dark mode on screens, dialogs, navigation | **Not tested** — no device or emulator available |
| Ad slot absence, login, messaging, billing | **Not tested** — same reason |

The last two rows decide whether this bundle is usable; until they are confirmed on a device it stays
experimental.

## Known limitations

- **Not device-tested.** Everything above is checks against the APK's own dex and resources, not
  screen behaviour.
- **No in-app toggle.** Each patch is on or off at patch time; a runtime switch would need a settings
  destination and a persisted preference inside Tandem's settings architecture.
- **Only night-aware UI changes.** Screens, WebViews or creatives that ignore `uiMode` look the same as
  they do with the system dark mode on.
- **Rewarded ads stay** — by design, as described above.
- **PairIP risk remains.** The checks that are bypassed are the two that break re-signed builds; a
  future server-side integrity signal could still refuse a patched client.

## Warnings

- Do not apply to any Tandem build other than 6.38.0, and do not force a version mismatch.
- Do not combine with another Tandem patch that injects at `Application.onCreate()`.
- Store updates will not install over the patched, differently-signed build.

## Building the bundle

```bash
# JDK 21, from the repository root
./gradlew :patches:buildAndroid
# -> patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp   (copy over Tandem/patches.mpp when it changes)
```

Patch sources live in `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/xiondigital/patches/tandem/` — one package per
patch plus `shared/Constants.kt` for the compatibility declarations.

The Morphe Gradle plugin is published only to GitHub Packages, which needs credentials even for public
packages: export `GITHUB_ACTOR` and a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `read:packages`, or set `gpr.user` /
`gpr.key` in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.

## Changelog

- **Unreleased** — `Remove ads`: community-ad composable (`Ljhp;->a`) plus ten AppLovin MAX / Meta
  Audience Network load methods reduced to `return-void`; rewarded formats and SDK init left intact.
  Eleven anchors verified in the stock `base.apk`.
- **Unreleased** — `Bypass PairIP checks`: `SignatureCheck.verifyIntegrity` and
  `LicenseClient.checkLicense` reduced to `return-void`; anchors verified in `classes2.dex`.
- **Unreleased** — `Disable Adjust tracking`: `Adjust.initSdk(AdjustConfig)` reduced to
  `return-void`; anchor verified in `classes2.dex`.
- **Unreleased** — `Force dark mode`: `UiModeManager.setApplicationNightMode(2)` injected at
  `TandemApp.onCreate()`; verified against the real APK.
- **Unreleased** — first bundle checked in at `patches.mpp` (4 patches, APK + APKM compatibility).
